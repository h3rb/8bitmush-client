Platform: Compiles with the IDE GameMaker Studio 1.2 - 1.4 era - could be upgraded to GMS 2.0 -- originally developed using Master Collection GMS 1.2

Multiple attempts were made to write an "omniclient" for web, iphone, ipad, android in "GameMaker Studio" but it was not a complete success.  

* Most compatible PC version was 8bitmushtiny.gmx (requires no OpenGL, can run on integrated graphics)
* Most complete/highest required specs version was 8bitclient_3 (requires OpenGL)
